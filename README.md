# Image Scraper

This image scraper was built on Oct, 2022, to scrape data (images) used to train the [Cyclegan Cyberpunk](https://github.com/pleix64/cyclegan-cyberpunk) deep learning network. 

The scraper is based on the Scrapy framework, and using Selenium for automatically browsing some dynamic webpages that otherwise do not load sufficient content.
